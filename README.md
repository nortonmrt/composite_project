# Composite structure analysis - Classical Laminate Theory

This project aims to give a basic project analysis for composite structures, using the classical laminate theory. Given the material properties, geometry and the mechanical loads of the structure, the outputs are:

- The stresses and strains in global and local coordinates of each lamina;
- Analysis fo the structure integrity in 3 failure theories: maximum stress, Tsai-Hill and Tsai-Wu;
- Failure graph;
- Graphical distribution of stresses and strains along the thickness.

In this first version the properties must be acquired experimentally, but for next versions it will be possible to use theorical methods such as the Mixture Rule.

The author does not take responsibility from the usage of this routine in real engineering projects. The aim of this implementation is purely educational.
